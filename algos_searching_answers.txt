1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
A real life example of a linear search would be looking for a lost dog at a neighbors house. I would go to each neighbor’s house in linear order, trying to find my lost dog.

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
A real life scenario would be searching for a book among the stacks of a library. If the book was Moby Dick, by the author Herman Melville, I would know to look in the M section. I could disregard all the stacks of A-L and I would know that I need to check M or higher (the second half of the stacks), from there I could keep parsing down the stacks until I was on the M section and then further parse that section down until I was at Me… and finally Melville. Then I could search through all the Melville titles to find “Moby Dick.

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
There would be 7 iterations.

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
There would be 3 iterations.

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
I would choose linear sort, because the binary search works only for sorted collections. Because the collection was unsorted, you’d have to iterate linearly through all items in the collection.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
I would choose binary search. This would allow me to divide the collection into smaller sections and would make it more manageable to search through a large collection. Binary search only works on sorted collections.

Programming Assignment:
6. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

var arr = ["albatross", "bouquet", "cat,", "dog", "environment", "face", "giraffe"]

 function findWord(arr, word) {
   var low = arr[0];
   var high = arr[arr.length -1];

   while (low <= high) {
     var mid = (arr.indexOf(low) + arr.indexOf(high)) /2;
     mid = Math.round(mid);

     if (arr[mid] > word) {
       high = arr[mid - 1]

     } else if (arr[mid] < word) {
       low = arr[mid + 1]

     } else {
       return arr[mid]
     }
   }
   return "Word not found"
 }

 findWord(arr, "albatross");

7. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

var petStore = ['fighting fish', 'goldfish', 'koi', 'gar', 'minnow', 'white-spotted goldfish', 'oscar', 'gourami']; 

 function findFish(arr, target) {
   for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
     value = arr[i];
     if (value === target) {
       var result = i;
     }
   }
   return result;
 }

 findFish(petStore, 'white-spotted goldfish');
