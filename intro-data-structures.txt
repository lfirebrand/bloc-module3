1. A line of people at an amusement park ride.

The line is composed of members, represented as strings.
There is a front to the line, as well as a back.
When someone enters the line, place them at the end.
People may leave the line whenever they see fit, and those behind them take their place.
Given the above real-world information, use an array data structure to code the following solution.

a) Use an array input: ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"]
	var friends = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"];

b) Insert a new person, "Mary" at the end of the line. In other words, you should insert Mary after Mike.
	friends.push("Mary");

c) Find a person in line named "Josh." This function should return the position of 2 in the array, (recall that arrays are 0-based).
	function findFriends(name) {
  	for (i = 0; i < friends.length; i++) {
    		if (friends[i] === name) {
      		return name + " is in line at position " + [i];
    		}
  	}
  	return name + " is not in line."
}
findFriends("Josh");

d) Find a person in line named "Emily." What should your function return if it does not find the item in the array?
findFriends("Emily"); Since Emily will not be found, it will return "Emily is not in line."

e) What if Ava wants to allow a friend, "Melissa", to cut in line in front of her? How would you code this so Melissa appears before Ava?
friends.splice(1, 0, "Maria");

f) If Patrick wants to leave the line, how would you delete him from the array?
friends.splice(4, 1);

2. Provide another real-world example that you can model using a data structure.
Another example could be managing available animals up for adoption at an animal shelter. A simple way would be an object array. You could set the array to include propeties such as `name`, `type` (i.e. dog or cat), `sex`, `status`, `size`, `age`.

3. How would your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
They could create functions to loop through the object array to find specific animals by type, age, sex and adoption status; add new animals when they come in; and remove animals once they are adopted.
