**Short Answer Questions**
1. Psuedocode is representational of actual code and helps developers determine the algorithm they’ll use to write their code. It allows humans to read and understand what the steps of the program is supposed to execute in plain English, before the developer codes it in their chosen language’s syntax.

2. If you run psuedocode on your computer, nothing will happen. It is not a programming language that a computer can compile and run.
